# Gemini Character Generator

A **Next.js + TypeScript** application for creating persistent AI characters from reference images, then generating new scenes with those characters while preserving their visual identity. The project uses **Google Gemini image generation** for still images and **Replicate** for optional image-to-video animation.

> Repository: `therealvallalhatatlan/v3`

## What it does

The app is built around a simple workflow:

1. Create a character and upload **1–5 reference images**.
2. Store the character's name, description, traits, and reference images.
3. Open the character workspace and generate new images from natural-language scene instructions.
4. Generate scenes with one or multiple characters in the same frame.
5. Control location, camera, aspect ratio, visual style, and style intensity.
6. Save generated images together with generation metadata and prompts.
7. Optionally turn a generated image into an animated video through Replicate.

The repository is currently a local-file-storage application rather than a database-backed SaaS. Character data and generated assets are written to the configured filesystem storage directory.

## Core features

### Character creation

The character creation screen accepts:

- Character name
- Character description / visual identity
- Comma-separated traits
- 1–5 reference images

Reference images are converted client-side to data URLs and sent to the character API. The application stores them under the configured storage directory.

### Character persistence

Characters are stored as JSON records containing:

- `id`
- `name`
- `description`
- `traits[]`
- `imagePaths[]`
- `createdAt`

The storage layer also supports updating and deleting characters.

### AI image generation

The `/api/generate` endpoint builds a structured prompt from the character definition and scene inputs, then calls Gemini's image generation endpoint.

The generator supports:

- Single-character scenes
- Multi-character scenes
- Up to 6 reference images per generation request
- Balanced reference-image selection across multiple characters
- Landscape `16:9`
- Portrait `9:16`
- Camera presets
- Visual style presets
- Adjustable style intensity
- Optional A/B style comparison
- Hungarian / English / mixed scene input normalization
- Scene packages with reusable location and continuity information
- Location fingerprints for continuity tracking

### Character identity locking

Prompt construction is deliberately more structured than a single free-form prompt. The prompt builder separates identity, anchors, physical appearance, outfit, texture, energy, scene, camera, style, and constraints.

For multi-character generations, the prompt additionally enforces:

- All requested characters appear in the same frame
- Characters remain visually distinct
- Faces and heads stay inside the frame
- Widescreen compositions leave adequate headroom
- Bodies, hands, feet, masks, and distinctive costume elements should not be unnecessarily cropped
- Characters must not be merged, replaced, or dropped

### Scene / continuity controls

A scene package can define a reusable location profile containing details such as:

- Location preset
- Location description
- Geometry
- Lighting and time
- Palette and texture
- Fixed props
- Camera continuity
- Continuity notes

Individual continuity flags can lock geometry, lighting, palette, props, and camera rules.

Built-in location presets currently include examples such as:

- Urban street
- Apartment
- Office
- Warehouse
- Rooftop
- Subway
- Forest
- Industrial yard
- Night highway
- Interrogation room
- Budai family room
- 1999 Budapest mall
- East-European McDonald's around 2000
- Land Rover interior POV
- White studio / turn-of-the-century sofa
- Hotel courtyard / pool / cocktail bar
- Vaulted cellar / server room

### Camera presets

The generation API includes built-in camera modes such as:

`closeup`, `wide`, `fisheye`, `handheld`, `dutch`, `birdseye`, `overtheshoulder`, `wormseye`, `speedcam1999`, `security-cam`, `telephoto-stakeout`, `cctv-distorted`, `reflection-pov`, `macro-forensic`, `pov-dashboard`, plus additional built-in Gonzo/Postmodern variants.

### Visual styles

Built-in styles currently include:

- `gritty`
- `noir-bw`
- `vhs-glitch`
- `neo-noir-neon`
- `dreamy-ethereal`
- `graphic-novel`
- `police-speed-photo`

The selected style can be combined with a numeric intensity value from `0` to `100`.

### Dynamic preset manager

Location Presets, Camera presets, and Styles can now be extended **without editing TypeScript source code**.

Open:

```text
/presets
```

The Preset Manager lets you:

- Add custom Location Presets
- Add custom Camera presets
- Add custom Styles
- Edit custom preset label/prompt data
- Delete custom presets
- Keep built-in presets read-only

Each custom preset has:

- `key` - machine-readable identifier, for example `abandoned-mall`
- `label` - human-readable name shown in the UI
- `prompt` - prompt block injected into generation
- `negative` - optional style-specific negative prompt

Custom presets are stored at:

```text
<STORAGE_DIR>/presets.json
```

The generator loads them at runtime. Creating a new preset therefore does not require a source-code change or a new preset type declaration.

The dynamic preset API is available through:

- `GET /api/presets`
- `POST /api/presets`
- `PATCH /api/presets`
- `DELETE /api/presets?id=<presetId>`

The generator validates custom camera, style, and location keys server-side before generation.

### Image normalization and storage

Generated images are decoded from Gemini's base64 output and processed with **Sharp**.

When an aspect ratio is selected, the storage layer normalizes the image to:

- `1536 × 864` for landscape `16:9`
- `864 × 1536` for portrait `9:16`

Images and their generation metadata are then saved to the filesystem.

### Image-to-video animation

The animation subsystem uses **Replicate** as its provider.

A generated image can be submitted with:

- Motion prompt
- Duration
- Character context

Animation jobs are persisted locally and expose statuses such as:

`queued`, `processing`, `done`, `failed`, `canceled`

The implementation also supports polling a provider prediction, downloading/saving the resulting MP4, and canceling an active job through the API layer.

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Framework | Next.js 14 App Router |
| Language | TypeScript |
| UI | React 18 |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS 3 |
| Image processing | Sharp |
| Still image generation | Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Image |
| Video generation | Replicate |
| IDs | `uuid` |
| Storage | Local filesystem + JSON |
| Build | Next.js / TypeScript |

The dependency list in `package.json` currently includes Next.js 14, React 18, Tailwind CSS 3, Sharp, UUID, TypeScript, PostCSS, and Autoprefixer.

## Requirements

Before starting, install:

- **Node.js 18+** recommended
- npm, pnpm, or another Node package manager
- A **Google Gemini API key** with access to image generation
- A **Replicate API token** only when video animation is enabled
- A writable local storage directory

The project is designed around server-side filesystem access, so deploy targets with ephemeral or read-only filesystems need a different storage adapter before production use.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/therealvallalhatatlan/v3.git
cd v3
```

### 2. Install dependencies

With npm:

```bash
npm install
```

Or with pnpm:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 3. Configure environment variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root.

Minimum configuration:

```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
STORAGE_DIR=./storage
```

For animation:

```env
REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=your_replicate_token
REPLICATE_VIDEO_MODEL_VERSION=owner/model-or-version
```

Optional Replicate configuration:

```env
REPLICATE_API_BASE_URL=https://api.replicate.com/v1
REPLICATE_INPUT_IMAGE_KEY=image
REPLICATE_INPUT_PROMPT_KEY=prompt
REPLICATE_INPUT_DURATION_KEY=duration
```

### Environment variable reference

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Yes | Google Gemini image-generation API key |
| `STORAGE_DIR` | Yes in a normal setup | Root directory for characters, reference images, generated images, animation files, and custom presets |
| `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN` | Only for video | Replicate authentication token |
| `REPLICATE_VIDEO_MODEL_VERSION` | Only for video | Replicate model slug (`owner/name`) or model version identifier |
| `REPLICATE_API_BASE_URL` | No | Replicate API base URL override |
| `REPLICATE_INPUT_IMAGE_KEY` | No | Input field name expected by the selected Replicate model |
| `REPLICATE_INPUT_PROMPT_KEY` | No | Prompt field name expected by the selected Replicate model |
| `REPLICATE_INPUT_DURATION_KEY` | No | Duration field name expected by the selected Replicate model |

> **Important:** Do not commit `.env.local` or API keys to Git.

### 4. Prepare the storage directory

The application creates required directories automatically when storage is initialized. A typical local development setup is:

```text
storage/
├── characters.json
├── presets.json
├── images/
├── generated/
└── ...
```

You can also point `STORAGE_DIR` at an absolute filesystem path.

Example on Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:STORAGE_DIR="L:\ai-storage"
```

Example in `.env.local`:

```env
STORAGE_DIR=L:\ai-storage
```

The path must be writable by the Node.js process.

### 5. Start the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Or:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Then open:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

The preset manager is available at:

```text
http://localhost:3000/presets
```

## Production build

Build the application:

```bash
npm run build
```

Start the production server:

```bash
npm run start
```

Equivalent pnpm commands:

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm start
```

## Application structure

## Generation request model

A generation request can contain fields such as:

```json
{
  "characterIds": ["character-1", "character-2"],
  "location": "late-night Budapest street",
  "mood": "tense",
  "actionPrompt": "the two characters argue beside a parked car",
  "camera": "wide",
  "aspectRatio": "landscape-16-9",
  "style": "gritty",
  "styleIntensity": 75,
  "compareStyle": "vhs-glitch",
  "scenePackage": {
    "locationProfile": {
      "preset": "urban-street",
      "detail": "wet street, sodium lamps, old storefronts"
    },
    "continuity": {
      "lockGeometry": true,
      "lockLighting": true,
      "lockPalette": true,
      "lockProps": false,
      "lockCameraRules": false
    },
    "shotTemplate": "establishing-wide"
  }
}
```

The endpoint validates IDs, camera/style selections, aspect ratio, scene package values, and style intensity before prompt generation. Custom preset keys are accepted when they exist in the preset store.

## How prompt generation works

The prompt builder converts each stored character into a **Character DNA** representation. It then combines that information with the scene package, camera preset, style block, negative constraints, and multi-character composition rules.

The resulting prompt is intentionally verbose and structured because the goal is continuity rather than purely open-ended image generation.

A typical single-character prompt is assembled from sections including:

```text
[IDENTITY]
[ANCHORS - DO NOT CHANGE]
[PHYSICAL]
[OUTFIT]
[TEXTURE]
[ENERGY]
[SCENE]
[SCENE PACKAGE META]
[CAMERA]
[STYLE]
[STRICT CONSTRAINTS]
[NEGATIVE]
```

Multi-character prompts add cast and composition sections so that every requested character is explicitly accounted for.

## Storage model

The current implementation uses local files instead of a database.

Characters are stored in:

```text
<STORAGE_DIR>/characters.json
```

Custom presets are stored in:

```text
<STORAGE_DIR>/presets.json
```

Reference images are stored under:

```text
<STORAGE_DIR>/images/<characterId>/
```

Generated images are stored under:

```text
<STORAGE_DIR>/generated/<characterId>/
```

Multi-character generations may additionally be written to a `duo--...` group directory.

Generated image metadata is stored next to the image as JSON. Metadata can contain the prompt, location, mood, camera, aspect ratio, style, style intensity, character IDs, scene package ID, location fingerprint, shot template, continuity notes, aliases, and creation time.

Animation jobs and video outputs live under:

```text
<STORAGE_DIR>/generated/<characterId>/animations/
```

## Development notes

### Local filesystem dependency

`lib/paths.ts` defaults the storage root to `E:/ai-storage` when `STORAGE_DIR` is not set. For portability, set `STORAGE_DIR` explicitly in `.env.local` for local development and deployment environments.

### Reference image limits

Character creation accepts up to 5 uploaded images. The Gemini generation layer uses at most 6 reference images in a single request and balances selection across characters for multi-character scenes.

### Dynamic presets

Custom presets are deliberately stored outside the repository source tree. The built-in prompt definitions remain in `lib/camera.ts`, `lib/sceneMapper.ts`, and `lib/style.ts`, while `lib/presetStore.ts` loads custom additions from `<STORAGE_DIR>/presets.json`.

This keeps the application portable and means a prompt designer can create new presets through `/presets` without creating another code commit.

### Aspect ratio handling

Gemini is explicitly requested to render either `16:9` or `9:16`. The application then uses Sharp to normalize the stored image dimensions to a fixed target size.

### Animation model flexibility

The Replicate adapter is intentionally configurable because different video models expose different input field names. Use the `REPLICATE_INPUT_*` environment variables when the selected model expects field names other than `image`, `prompt`, or `duration`.

## Troubleshooting

### `GEMINI_API_KEY not set`

Set `GEMINI_API_KEY` in `.env.local`, then restart the Next.js dev server.

### `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN is not set`

The still-image generator does not require Replicate. This error only affects animation functionality. Add `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN` when video generation is enabled.

### `REPLICATE_VIDEO_MODEL_VERSION is not set`

Animation also requires `REPLICATE_VIDEO_MODEL_VERSION`. The adapter accepts either a model slug such as `owner/name` or a version identifier.

### Storage directory is not writable

Check `STORAGE_DIR` and verify that the Node.js process has read/write access. On Windows, confirm that the path exists and is accessible by the account running the development server.

### A new preset does not appear in the generator

Use the Preset Manager's **Refresh** button, then refresh the character workspace. The `/api/presets` endpoint is explicitly dynamic and is not statically cached.

### A custom preset is rejected by generation

Make sure the preset still exists in `<STORAGE_DIR>/presets.json`, and that its key uses only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens. The generator validates custom keys server-side.

### Generated images are cropped unexpectedly

The application normalizes generated images with Sharp using `fit: cover`. The crop is centered. For multi-character landscape scenes, the prompt builder explicitly asks the model to keep both heads, faces, and bodies comfortably inside the frame before post-processing.

### Replicate returns HTTP 402

The animation adapter surfaces provider billing failures as a `402` response. Check the Replicate account billing/credit status.

## Security considerations

This project currently stores assets on the server filesystem and exposes generation and preset management through application routes. Before deploying it as a public multi-user service, consider adding:

- Authentication and authorization, especially for `/presets`
- Per-user storage isolation
- Request rate limiting
- Upload size/type validation
- Abuse prevention
- API usage quotas
- Secure persistent object storage
- Database-backed metadata
- Background job processing for long-running generation
- Signed/expiring asset URLs where appropriate
- Structured logging and monitoring

API keys must remain server-side and should never be exposed to client code.

## Current limitations

This repository is best understood as an evolving generation engine / prototype rather than a finished multi-tenant production platform.

Notable limitations of the current architecture:

- Local filesystem persistence
- No built-in authentication layer visible in the current codebase
- No database layer
- Generation is performed synchronously in the image-generation route
- Video processing depends on an external Replicate model configuration
- Production deployment requires persistent storage or a storage-adapter rewrite
- Preset Manager access is currently not authenticated
